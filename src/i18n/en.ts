                "People high in Openness to Experience live in a world of ideas, possibilities, and untouched beauty. They're drawn to abstract thinking, imagination, and the unconventional. Their creativity isn’t just for fantasy—it drives them to explore philosophy, art, culture, and innovation. They're naturally curious and constantly seek to broaden their perspective.\n\nAccording to IPIP and the NEO-PI-R model, Openness is closely related to artistic interest, intellectual curiosity, and tolerance for ambiguity. These individuals dislike rigid routines and prefer taking paths less traveled. They often initiate fresh ideas and bring a unique perspective to any group or organization.\n\nHowever, their rich inner world can sometimes make them seem ungrounded. They may struggle with finishing one idea before jumping to the next, and their unconventional approach can appear eccentric to others. They're idealistic, but not always practical.\n\nStill, the world needs Dreamers. Without them, there would be no art, innovation, or transformative change.",
